    "You RFSoC2x2 platform consists of two RF Analogue-to-Digital Converters (RF ADCs). In this demonstration, we will use both of these ADCs to implement an OFDM receiver and Spectrum Analyzer for the 700MHz and 3500MHz bands. The RFSoC2x2 also consists of two RF Digital-to-Analogue Converters (RF DACs), again we will use each DAC for this demonstration to implement an OFDM transmitter on the 700MHz and 3500MHz bands.\n",

    "Below are the code cells that will be ran when Voila is called. The procedure is fairly straight forward. Load the rfsoc-xilinx-adapt library, initialise the overlay, and display the spectrum analyzer. All you have to ensure is that the above command is executed in the terminal and you have launched a browser tab using the given address. You do not need to run these code cells individually to create the voila dashboard.\n",
